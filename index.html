                    <p>
                        Parvos Granum is a character in the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki">Warframe</a> universe. He is the founder of the group known as the Corpus, a society that values profit above everything else. He was imprisoned for millennia after a failed assasination attempt by his Board of Directors. This led to the corruption of the group, coming up with new forms of "payment" such as "reposessions", which consists in the taking individual's valuables in the form of body parts if they are deemed too inefficient. 
                    </p>
                            
                    <p>
                        Parvos' philosophy (and that of the Corpus previous to their fall) was centered around desire. He shunned contentment, for he saw it as idle or slothfulness.
